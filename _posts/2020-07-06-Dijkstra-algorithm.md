## Dijkstra algorithm

### 1. History

The Dijkstra Algorithm is an algorithm invented by the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1959 to solve the shortest path problem. It belongs to the field of graph theory.

### 2. Algorithm

Let's define some useful therms :  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S"> is the list of the vertices of the graph  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_0"> is the original vertice  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l(x,y)"> is the weight of the edge (between to vertices)  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta_s(x)"> is the length between the vertice<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_0"> and the vertice <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x">
