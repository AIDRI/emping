# Matrix multiplication with a time complexity lower than $O(N^3)$  

> In this post, we will try to understand differents algorithms for matrix multiplication with a time complexity lower than $O(N^3)$.  

> We will study three different algorithms : Strassen's algorithm, Coppersmith & Winograd's algorithm and finally William's algorithm.  

> The complexity of the algorithms will decrease as the post progresses.  

> You can find other posts on my [blog](https://aidri.github.io/emping/blog/).  

> Some characters can bug on the phone version.
