## Who I am...
My name is Adrien and I live in France. I've been passionate about Artificial Intelligence since I was 12 years old, but I've been really involved in it since 2019 (when I was 14). 
I first did training courses on machine learning, then on deep learning. I quickly realized that I preferred everything related to computer vision. Recently, I started to learn algorithm and do a lot of problems on codeforces
